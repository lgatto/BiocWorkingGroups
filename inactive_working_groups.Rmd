## Package Review

- Description: The package review working group was established to review and
revise the current review process for Bioconductor. It also was tasked with
updating Bioconductor package guidelines and package submission
documentation. Its current focus is to update, clean up, and reorganize the
material presented at http://contributions.bioconductor.org/. This is <b>not</b> the
group to volunteer to become a Bioconductor package reviewer. This group is to
refine the requirements for a Bioconductor package.
